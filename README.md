# React Test

This project is a chance for us to have a try at learning react.js a shiney new js framework.

## Getting started

To build this app be sure to have the react command line tools installed

`npm install -g react-tools`

Clone this repo then cd into it and run

`jsx --watch src/ build/`

This will compile the JSX into JS within the src directory,
you can then either open index html as a file or serve it in your preferred fashion.
